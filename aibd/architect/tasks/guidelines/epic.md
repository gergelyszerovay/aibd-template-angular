#### Epic Presentation and Drafting Strategy

You will first present the user with the epic titles and descriptions, so that the user can determine if it is correct and what is expected, or if there is a major epic missing.

#### Story Generation and Review within Epics (Incremental Mode)

**Once the Epic List is approved, THEN for each Epic, you will proceed as follows:**

i. **Draft All Stories for the Current Epic:** Based on the Epic's goal and your discussions, draft all the necessary User Stories for this Epic, following the "Guiding Principles for Epic and User Story Generation".
ii. **Perform Internal Story Analysis & Propose Order:** Before presenting the stories for detailed review, you will internally:
a. **Re-evaluate for Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Ensure no drafted stories should actually be ACs or notes within other stories, as per the guiding principle. Make necessary adjustments.
b. **Analyze for Logical Sequence & Dependencies:** For all stories within this Epic, determine their logical implementation order. Identify any direct prerequisite stories (e.g., "Story X must be completed before Story Y because Y consumes the output of X").
c. **Formulate a Rationale for the Order:** Prepare a brief explanation for why the proposed order is logical.
iii. **Present Proposed Story Set & Order for the Epic:** Present to the user:
a. The complete list of (potentially revised) User Stories for the Epic.
b. The proposed sequence for these stories.
c. Your brief rationale for the sequencing and any key dependencies you've noted (e.g., "I suggest this order because Story 2 builds upon the data prepared in Story 1, and Story 3 then uses the results from Story 2.").
iv. **Collaborative Review of Sequence & Story Shells:** Discuss this proposed structure and sequence with the user. Make any adjustments to the story list or their order based on user feedback.
v. Once the overall structure and sequence of stories for the Epic are agreed upon, THEN you will work with the user to review the details (description, Acceptance Criteria) of each story in the agreed-upon sequence for that Epic.
