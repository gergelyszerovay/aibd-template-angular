# Autonomous Implement Next Story Task Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive validation framework for autonomous agents implementing story tasks. The agent should systematically work through each item to ensure the implementation meets all requirements and quality standards.

## 1. STORY IDENTIFICATION & PREPARATION

- [ ] Next story task has been identified from `/workspace/docs/stories/`
- [ ] Story file has been read and understood completely
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are clearly identified
- [ ] Task breakdown and technical guidance are reviewed
- [ ] Dependencies and prerequisites are understood

## 2. REQUIREMENTS IMPLEMENTATION

- [ ] All functional requirements specified in the story are implemented
- [ ] All acceptance criteria defined in the story are met
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions are handled gracefully
- [ ] Implementation follows the technical guidance provided
- [ ] All tasks within the story are completed

## 3. CODING STANDARDS & PROJECT STRUCTURE

- [ ] All new/modified code adheres to Operational Guidelines
- [ ] Code aligns with Project Structure (file locations, naming conventions)
- [ ] Tech Stack requirements followed for technologies/versions used
- [ ] API Reference and Data Models followed for relevant changes
- [ ] Basic security best practices applied (input validation, error handling, no hardcoded secrets)
- [ ] Code is well-commented where necessary (complex logic, not obvious statements)

## 4. QUALITY ASSURANCE & TESTING

- [ ] Project builds successfully without errors (`pnpm build` if applicable)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes (`pnpm typecheck`)
- [ ] ESLint passes without new errors or warnings (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Circular dependency check passes (`pnpm madge`)
- [ ] All tests pass successfully (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] No new linter errors or warnings introduced
- [ ] Test coverage meets project standards (if defined)

## 5. FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION

- [ ] Functionality has been manually verified (running app locally, testing endpoints)
- [ ] All story acceptance criteria have been validated
- [ ] Integration points work correctly with existing system
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed where relevant

## 6. DEPENDENCIES & CONFIGURATION

- [ ] Any new dependencies are documented and justified
- [ ] New dependencies recorded in appropriate files (package.json, etc.)
- [ ] No known security vulnerabilities in new dependencies
- [ ] Environment variables or configurations documented securely
- [ ] Build configuration updated if necessary

## 7. STORY ADMINISTRATION

- [ ] All tasks within the story file are marked as complete
- [ ] Story status updated to 'Done'
- [ ] Development decisions and clarifications documented in story file
- [ ] Story wrap-up section completed with relevant notes
- [ ] Agent model used during development documented
- [ ] Changelog properly updated with implementation changes

## 8. CODE DOCUMENTATION

- [ ] Inline code documentation (JSDoc, TSDoc) completed for new functions and classes
- [ ] Complex logic documented with appropriate comments
- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear variable and function names
- [ ] No external technical documentation updates required (handled by architect)

## 9. FILE MANAGEMENT & OUTPUT

- [ ] Only story-specific files modified (no project documentation changes)
- [ ] Story markdown file updated with implementation details
- [ ] All changes properly committed with descriptive messages
- [ ] File structure maintained according to project standards

## 10. TASK REPORT GENERATION

- [ ] Task report created using specified template
- [ ] All changes made are documented specifically
- [ ] Quality checks results included
- [ ] Story requirements satisfaction documented
- [ ] Implementation summary accurately reflects work completed

## 11. FINAL VALIDATION

- [ ] All applicable checklist items have been addressed
- [ ] Story is ready for review or next phase
- [ ] No blocking issues remain unresolved
- [ ] Implementation meets all defined quality standards
- [ ] Story can be considered complete and ready for deployment
