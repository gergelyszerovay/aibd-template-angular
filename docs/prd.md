---

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to discover and explore smoothie recipes easily
- Provide intuitive ingredient-based search for recipes
- Allow filtering by tags/categories (e.g., vegan, breakfast, summer)
- Offer detailed recipe views with all necessary information
- Enhance user experience for smoothie enthusiasts

### Business Goals & Success Metrics

- **Business Goals:**

- **Success Metrics:**
  - Number of active users per month
  - Number of recipes viewed per session
  - User satisfaction score (via feedback)
  - Time to first successful recipe search
  - _(Please specify baseline and target values for each metric)_

### Background Context

The Smoothie Recipe Angular Web App aims to address the need for a user-friendly platform where smoothie enthusiasts can find recipes based on available ingredients and personal preferences. Current solutions often lack intuitive search and filtering, making it difficult for users to find suitable recipes quickly. By focusing on ingredient-based search and tag filtering, this app will streamline the discovery process and improve user satisfaction.

### User Personas & Research

- **Primary Persona:**
  - Health-conscious individuals seeking quick, nutritious smoothie ideas
  - Often have specific dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, high-protein)
  - Value convenience and easy ingredient-based discovery
- **User Needs & Pain Points:**
  - Want to use up ingredients on hand
  - Frustrated by recipe sites with poor filtering/search
  - Desire for inspiration and variety
- **User Research:**
  - _[Assumption: No formal user research conducted yet. Please add findings if available.]_
- **Competitive Analysis:**
  - _[Assumption: No detailed competitive analysis included. Please add if available.]_
  - Noted competitors: AllRecipes, Yummly, niche smoothie blogs

2. NFR2: Search/filter operations should return results in under 1 second for typical use cases.
3. NFR3: The UI should be intuitive and easy to use.
4. NFR4: The app should be available 99.5% of the time (excluding planned maintenance).
5. NFR5: The app should handle at least 100 concurrent users without performance degradation _(please confirm expected load)_.
6. NFR6: Error states (e.g., no results, network issues) must be clearly communicated to the user with recovery options.
7. NFR7: No user accounts or user data are present in the MVP; all features are available without login or personalization.

## 3. MVP Scope & Validation

### In Scope (MVP)

- Ingredient-based recipe search
- Tag/category filtering
- Recipe details view
- Responsive web UI

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Nutrition data and prep time display
- User authentication and profile management
- Recipe creation or editing by users
- Social sharing features
- Advanced analytics/dashboard

### Rationale for Scope Decisions

- Focused on core discovery and exploration experience for launch
- Excluded features are either non-essential for initial validation or require significant additional complexity

### MVP Validation Approach

- **Success Criteria:**
  - Users can successfully find and favorite at least one recipe using ingredient/tag search
  - At least 80% of test users report satisfaction with search/filter experience
- **Feedback Mechanisms:**
  - In-app feedback prompt after recipe view
  - Optional user survey after first week of use
- **Learning Goals:**
  - Validate demand for ingredient-based search
  - Identify most-used tags and features for future prioritization
- **Timeline:**
  - Target MVP launch: _(please specify date)_

---

## 4. User Experience Requirements

### User Journeys & Flows

- **Primary Flow:**
  1. User lands on home/search page
  2. User enters/selects ingredients
  3. User applies tag/category filters (optional)
  4. User browses recipe results
  5. User views recipe details
- **Edge Cases:**
  - No recipes found for selected ingredients/tags
  - Network or server errors

### Usability Requirements

- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliance
- Platform: Web responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Performance: Search/filter results in <1s
- Error Handling: Clear error messages and retry options
- User Feedback: In-app feedback prompt after recipe view

### UI Requirements

- **Information Architecture:**
  - Home/Search, Results, Recipe Details
- **Critical UI Components:**
  - Ingredient search bar, tag filter chips, recipe cards, details modal/page
- **Visual Design:**
  - _[Assumption: No style guide provided. Please specify branding/colors if available.]_
- **Navigation Structure:**
  - Top/bottom nav bar for main sections

---

## 5. Technical Guidance

### Initial Architecture Direction

- **Frontend:** Angular (latest stable)
- **Backend/API:** No backend in MVP; all recipe data is fetched from a static JSON file in the Angular project's assets folder.
- **Data Source:** Static JSON file (see sample: `assets/sample-data.json`).
- **Sample Data Structure:**
  - Each recipe includes: id, name, description, servings, prepTime, difficulty, ingredients (array of name, amount, unit), instructions, tags (array), tips (array)
  - Example file: `/workspace/docs/design/sample-data.json`
- **Deployment:** _[Assumption: Not specified. Please specify hosting preferences.]_
- **Repository:** Monorepo (assumed)
- **Service Architecture:** Monolith (N/A for static frontend)
- **Testing:** Unit + Integration (assumed)
- **Integration Points:** None for MVP
- **Development Environment:** Node.js, Angular CLI, Git

### Technical Constraints & Decisions

- All user data must be handled securely and comply with privacy standards (if/when user accounts are added)
- App must be easily deployable to static hosting platforms (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- No server-side code or API required for MVP
- _[Please specify any non-negotiable technical requirements or preferences.]_

### Areas for Technical Investigation

- Best practices for loading and searching static JSON data in Angular
- Scalability for future user-generated content (if backend is added post-MVP)
- Accessibility testing tools and automation

### Guidance on Technical Debt

- Prioritize MVP delivery, but document any shortcuts or deferred improvements for post-launch
